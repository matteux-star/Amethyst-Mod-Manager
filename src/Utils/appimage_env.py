"""
Utils/appimage_env.py
The canonical list of AppImage/bundle-injected environment variables, and the
scrub function that removes them from a child-process environment.

Inside the AppImage, the sharun runtime (and our own launcher wrapper) exports
vars that point into the transient /tmp/.mount_* FUSE mount — loader paths,
GTK/GIO module caches, CA-bundle paths, our private FONTCONFIG_FILE, … A HOST
child that inherits them loads the bundle's libraries instead of its own
(crashes, TLS failures), or keeps using paths that dangle the moment the
AppImage exits. sharun's anylinux.so execve hook scrubs SOME of these
automatically, but it is disabled on some build hosts (ANYLINUX_LIB=0) and
doesn't know about vars our own wrapper adds — so the Python side must not
rely on it.

History: three modules (protontricks, xdg, smapi_installer) each grew their
own hand-maintained copy of this list, and they drifted — a var added to one
was silently missing from the others. This module is now the single source of
truth; the per-module wrappers keep their differing POLICIES (no-op outside
the AppImage vs. always-strip) but share the list and the strip logic.

Prefix semantics: an env var is dropped when its name STARTS WITH an entry
below — so "FONTCONFIG_" covers FONTCONFIG_FILE / _PATH / _SYSROOT and
"SHARUN_" covers every sharun knob.
