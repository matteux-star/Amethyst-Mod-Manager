Utils/xdg.py
Helpers for launching host-system programs (xdg-open etc.) safely from
a polluted shell environment.

Inside an AppImage, anylinux.so (LD_PRELOAD-injected by quick-sharun) hooks
execve and scrubs AppDir-pointing env vars from child processes — so we
don't need to do anything special there. sharun also doesn't use
LD_LIBRARY_PATH; it invokes the dynamic linker with --library-path.

host_env() therefore only protects against pollution from *outside* the
AppImage: conda/pyenv/Steam-runtime can leave LD_LIBRARY_PATH pointing at
incompatible libraries, which would break xdg-open or Dolphin.
