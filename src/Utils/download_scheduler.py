"""Double-ended download dispatch for collection installs (toolkit-neutral).

Problem: with N equal download workers all pulling from one size-sorted list,
many tiny archives finish faster than the Nexus API can hand out the next CDN
link, so the queue stutters and bandwidth sits idle until a big mod happens to
land in a slot.

Fix: dedicate ONE worker to the largest-remaining mods (it stays busy on long
transfers that keep the pipe full) and let the other workers burn through the
smallest-remaining mods from the other end. They converge in the middle, so
every mod is dispatched exactly once and the link-fetch latency of the small
mods is hidden behind the big worker's ongoing transfer.

This module only owns the *dispatch order*; the actual per-mod work (link
fetch, download, hand-off to the install queue) is the caller's `work` fn.
