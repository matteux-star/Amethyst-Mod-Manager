"""stderr_capture.py

Mirror everything written to ``sys.stderr`` — plus any uncaught exception on
the main thread or a worker thread — into the application log panel via
``Utils.app_log.app_log``.

Rationale: Python tracebacks, ``warnings``, and stderr writes from third-party
libraries never reach the GUI log otherwise. Users who hit an error can then
see it (and copy/share it) straight from the log panel instead of having to
launch from a terminal.

Design:
 - ``_Tee`` wraps the real stderr: it forwards writes to the terminal unchanged
   AND buffers them into complete lines that are handed to ``app_log``. The tee
   never raises into its caller — a logging failure must not break the write it
   was mirroring.
 - ``sys.excepthook`` / ``threading.excepthook`` format uncaught tracebacks and
   send them to ``app_log`` as well. The default hooks already write to stderr
   (which the tee would catch), but explicit hooks tag them clearly and keep
   working even if stderr is later re-wrapped.

``install()`` is idempotent and best-effort; a failure here must never stop the
app from starting.

    """Mirror the process's real stderr (fd 2) into a file on disk, so a startup
    crash trace survives even when the app is launched from a desktop icon /
    AppImage with no terminal attached.

    This is the on-disk equivalent of ``run_qt.sh``'s ``2> >(tee …)`` shell
    redirect — but done inside Python so it works identically for the AppImage
    and flatpak builds (which never run ``run_qt.sh``). It must be installed as
    early as possible (before Qt / MainWindow construction) so a crash during
    startup is captured.

    Mechanism: ``os.dup2`` redirects fd 2 itself onto the log file, which is the
    only way to also capture output from C libraries (Qt, libloot, …), the
    interpreter's own fatal-error messages, and ``faulthandler`` — none of which
    go through ``sys.stderr``. The terminal (if any) still sees stderr because we
    tee: the file gets fd 2, and ``sys.stderr`` is rebound to a Python-level tee
    that also writes to the original terminal fd.

    Written to ``<log_dir>/run-qt-stderr.log`` (defaults to
    ``get_config_dir()``, matching the from-source path). The previous run's log
    is rotated to ``.old`` so old tracebacks don't mix into current triage.

    Idempotent and best-effort — any failure here must never block startup.
