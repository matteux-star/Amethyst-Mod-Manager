"""
filemap.py
Build and write a filemap.txt that resolves mod file conflicts.

Algorithm: walk enabled mods from lowest priority to highest priority.
For each file, record (relative_path, source_mod). Higher-priority mods
overwrite lower-priority entries — no conflicts remain in the output.

Format (one line per file):
    <relative/path/to/file>\t<mod_name>

Paths are stored in their original case but deduplicated case-insensitively
so that Windows-style case-insensitive conflicts are handled correctly.

Mod Index
---------
modindex.bin lives next to filemap.txt and caches the file list of every
mod so that build_filemap() can skip the expensive disk scan on every
enable/disable/reorder.  The index is only updated when mods are installed
or removed (or when the user hits the Refresh button).

Index format — msgpack binary, v4:
    {"v": 4, "mods": [[mod_name, [[rel_key, rel_str, kind], ...]], ...]}
where <kind> is "n" (normal) or "r" (unused legacy, kept for format compatibility).
Paths stored in the index reflect the raw on-disk casing of each mod's files.
build_filemap() normalizes folder-case across mods when assembling the merged
filemap output, but the index itself stays a faithful mirror of disk so that
deploy can construct correct source paths regardless of cross-mod casing.

    A common mistake is copying Mods/<ModName>/ directly into staging, giving

    per_mod_strip_prefixes — optional dict mapping mod name to a list of
    top-level folder names to strip for that mod only (contents move up one
    level during deployment).  Merged with strip_prefixes when scanning.

    allowed_extensions — when non-empty, only files with a matching lowercase
    extension (e.g. {".pak"}) are included in the filemap.  Pass None or an
    empty set to include all files (default behaviour).

    root_deploy_folders — no longer used; kept for call-site compatibility.
    Previously wrote a ``filemap_root.txt``; routing is now done via
    ``custom_routing_rules`` at deploy time.

    conflict_ignore_filenames — lowercase filenames (not paths) excluded from
    conflict tracking.  Files still appear in the filemap but do not count
    toward a mod's conflict status.  Pass None or an empty set to disable.

    excluded_loose_filenames — lowercase glob patterns; matching files are
    dropped from the filemap entirely, but only when the file is loose (no
    parent folder).  Same-named files nested in folders are unaffected.

    allowed_top_level_folders — when non-empty, any foldered entry whose first
    path segment is not in this set is dropped from the filemap.  Loose
    top-level files (no folder) are not affected by this rule.

    excluded_mod_files — dict mapping mod name to a set of lowercase rel_key
    paths that should be excluded from the filemap for that mod.  Excluded
    files are treated as if the mod does not have them, so the next
    lower-priority mod that has the same file wins instead.
