"""Hard-link cross-device validation (GUI-agnostic).

Hardlinks (`os.link`) require the source and destination to live on the same
filesystem. When the deploy mode is Hardlink, every directory the game deploys
into must sit on the same device as the mod staging folder — otherwise deploy
would fail at link time. This module holds the pure detection so the config
UIs (Tk add-game dialog, Qt configure-game view) can block the save and warn.

The set of directories that must match is game-specific and lives in
``game.get_hardlink_deploy_targets()`` — the game directory by default, plus
the Proton prefix / native data dir for games that deploy there (BG3, The
Sims 4, Jagged Alliance 3, Dragon Age Origins). BG3 with an empty prefix
(native Linux Larian build) reports only the game dir, so only that matters.

Ported from the Tk ``gui.add_game_dialog`` save-time check.
