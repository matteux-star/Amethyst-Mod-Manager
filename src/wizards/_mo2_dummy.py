_mo2_dummy.py
Build a synthetic ("dummy") Mod Organizer 2 instance so PGPatcher's
"Conflict Resolution Mod Manager = Mod Organizer 2" mode can attribute each
conflicting loose file back to its owning mod — giving MO2-parity per-mod
conflict sorting without a real MO2 / USVFS install.

How PGPatcher reads an MO2 instance (from PGModManager.cpp):
  * ``modorganizer.ini`` in the instance dir is parsed for ``gameName=``,
    ``selected_profile=``, ``gamePath=`` and the ``base_directory`` /
    ``mod_directory`` / ``profiles_directory`` keys.  ``mod_directory`` and
    ``profiles_directory`` default to ``<base>/mods`` and ``<base>/profiles``
    when omitted, so we only need ``base_directory``.
  * ``profiles/<selected_profile>/modlist.txt`` is walked TOP→BOTTOM.  Our
    manager already uses MO2's exact on-disk format and ordering (top line =
    highest priority, ``+`` / ``-`` / ``*`` / ``#`` / ``*_separator`` markers),
    so we copy it through verbatim.
  * Each enabled mod's folder must exist under ``mod_directory``.  Rather than
    building a symlink tree (which adds a Wine symlink-traversal failure mode),
    we point ``mod_directory`` straight at the real staging mods folder — the
    modlist names are exactly the staging subfolder names.

PGPatcher still reads the files it actually patches from the deployed game Data
folder; the dummy only supplies the file→mod map, so a normal deploy is still
required.  Launch PGPatcher with ``--ignore-mo2vfscheck`` since no USVFS layer
is present.
