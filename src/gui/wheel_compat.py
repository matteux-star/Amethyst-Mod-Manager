Mouse wheel event compatibility between Tk 8.6 and Tk 9.0 on Linux.

Tk 8.6 (AppImage): X11 wheel notches arrive as <Button-4>/<Button-5> only.
Tk 9.0 (Flatpak):  TIP 474 translates Button-4/5 into <MouseWheel> with
                   event.delta of +/-120 per notch, but bindings on the
                   literal <Button-4>/<Button-5> still fire. Without a guard
                   every notch scrolls twice.

Usage: wrap <Button-4>/<Button-5> handlers with ``skip_if_mousewheel`` (or
check ``LEGACY_WHEEL_REDUNDANT`` directly) so they no-op on Tk >= 8.7.
