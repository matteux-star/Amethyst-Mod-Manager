"""safe_emit — emit a Signal that may have lost its C++ owner.

Wizard views hand their bound Signals to daemon workers (and to portal
file-picker callbacks, which fire on a worker thread).  If the user closes
the tab while the worker is still running, the view is deleteLater()'d and a
later ``sig.emit(...)`` raises ``RuntimeError: Signal source has been
deleted`` — which, raised inside a worker's except handler, kills the whole
thread.  The views' ``_closing`` guards only protect the slot side; this
protects the emit side.  Late emits are simply dropped: the object they
would update no longer exists.
