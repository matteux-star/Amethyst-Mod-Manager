# clients have no global coordinate system — window position reports as (0,0)
# and mapToGlobal is wrong — so QToolTip (which needs global coords to place the
# tip) mis-anchors, badly once QT_SCALE_FACTOR != 1 compounds the logical/
# physical size mismatch. XWayland exposes real global coords so tooltips place
# correctly and scaling stays exact; it also fixes the Wayland splitter/colour-
# picker lag. The flatpak build already does this. `:=` respects a user override.
